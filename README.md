````sql
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Age IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Age,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Gender IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Gender,
    SUM(CASE WHEN "Education Level" IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Education,
    SUM(CASE WHEN "Job Title" IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Job_Title,
    SUM(CASE WHEN "Years of Experience" IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Experience,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Salary IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Missing_Salary

There are 9 missing values, we can drop them as they dont impact the databse, which has 6705 rows

### 2. We can delete the missing values.

````sql
DELETE FROM salary_data
WHERE age IS NULL
   OR "Gender" IS NULL
   OR "Education Level" IS NULL
   OR "Job Title" IS NULL
   OR "Years of Experience" IS NULL
   OR "Salary" IS NULL;
````

````sql
SELECT "Job Title", ROUND(AVG("Salary"),2) AS Avg_Salary
FROM salary_data
GROUP BY "Job Title"
ORDER BY Avg_Salary DESC
limit 10;
````
